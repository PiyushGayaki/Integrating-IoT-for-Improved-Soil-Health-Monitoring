# Integrating-IoT-for-Improved-Soil-Health-Monitoring
IoT devices with moisture, humidity, temperature, and pH sensors can help farmers improve crop yields while minimizing resource waste. They can be used to monitor and enhance soil health, create crop forecasts and fertilizer recommendations, and create a more sustainable, efficient, and resilient food system.

# Proposed System
System will provide an ability for tracking soil moisture percentage, temperature, and pH value of soil with the system proposed in this paper. We use soil-moisture sensor to find the moisture content in soil. Along with this , it uses LM35D (Temperature-Sensor) to calculate the environment's temperature. Likewise, we utilize a pH-sensor to find pH-value for the soil, and the integration of these sensors will be done with Arduino platform. The collected data will be sent to ThingSpeak with the help of Arduino and Esp8266 for wi-fi capabilities and user could access the data directly from Thingspeak server in a graphical way or in tabular form.
