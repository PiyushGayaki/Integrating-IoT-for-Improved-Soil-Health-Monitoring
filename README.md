# Integrating-IoT-for-Improved-Soil-Health-Monitoring
IoT devices with moisture, humidity, temperature, and pH sensors can help farmers improve crop yields while minimizing resource waste. They can be used to monitor and enhance soil health, create crop forecasts and fertilizer recommendations, and create a more sustainable, efficient, and resilient food system.

# Proposed System
System will provide an ability for tracking soil moisture percentage, temperature, and pH value of soil with the system proposed in this paper. We use soil-moisture sensor to find the moisture content in soil. Along with this , it uses LM35D (Temperature-Sensor) to calculate the environment's temperature. Likewise, we utilize a pH-sensor to find pH-value for the soil, and the integration of these sensors will be done with Arduino platform. The collected data will be sent to ThingSpeak with the help of Arduino and Esp8266 for wi-fi capabilities and user could access the data directly from Thingspeak server in a graphical way or in tabular form.

## A. System Architecture
1. Hardware setup: Connect the LM35D sensor to Arduino-Uno Analog Input to measure the soil temperature, pH-sensor to determine pH value of soil, FC-28 soil moisture sensor for measuring soil moisture content, ESP8266 NodeMCU module to connect the system to internet.
2. Sensor calibration: Calibrate the sensors by measuring their output readings against known values to ensure accurate readings.
3. Data acquisition: Collect sensor data using Arduino-Uno, and store the data in suitable format for analysis.
4. Cloud-based storage and visualization: Send the data to Cloud platforms, such as Thingspeak or Google Cloud, for storage and visualization. This will allow for easy access and sharing of the data.
5. Real-time monitoring: Use the ESP8266 NodeMCU module for connecting systems to the 
internet and allow for real time monitoring of soil health features and crop yield prediction.

## B. Circuit Explanation
1. In accordance to connect the LM35D temperature sensor to the Arduino-Uno Board, we wired its VCC(+) pin to the Arduino's 5V pin, its GND(-) pin to its GND(-) pin, and it's OUT pin to any of the Arduino's analogue input ports, such as A0.
2. For connecting the FC-28 Soil-Moisture sensor, attach the sensor's VCC(+) pin to the Arduino's 5V pin, it's GND pin to Arduino’s GND pin, and it's OUT pin to any of the Arduino's analogue input pins (for instance, A1).
3. Connect the pH sensor's VCC(+) pin to the Arduino's 5V pin, its GND(-) pin to Arduino’s GND(-) pin, and its output pin to any of the Arduino's analogue input pins (for instance, A2) to complete the circuit.
4. Connect the VCC(-) pin of the ESP8266 NodeMCU module to the 3.3V pin of the Arduino or we can power it directly from Computer (Here we use Computer as Power Source, the GND(-) pin to the Arduino's GND(-) pin, and the RX( Receive PIN) and TX(Transmit PIN) of the Arduino's to the digital pins of NodeMCU GPIO4 and GPIO5.
Once the modules and sensors are connected to the Arduino-Uno, we write the necessary code to 
read the sensor values and send them to the cloud using the ESP8266 NodeMCU module.

#Important Note
I am going to Public The Research Paper on this Project, So please Wait as I public the paper I will upload it here also and it will content each and every step and information about code and devices and there circuit connection.
